# Why Another Post on Programming Languages?
This homepage has its origin in a portfolio site. As such it should present my skills as a software engineer and so on. My old CV and many CVs by candidates I interviewed included a section on programming languages. I don't like that for several reasons:

* They are just buzz words for recruiters.
* Passed projects give way better insight into one's programming skills.
* A good engineer knows several languages, important patterns and most importantly can learn a new language fairly quickly. That is not to say that fully understanding a new language is easy.
* A shortlist cannot cover one's preferences and specialties.

So I created the following list. My favourite languages are marked with an asterisk.

The list is more or less in chronological order.

##Turbo Pascal/Delphi
Turbo Pascal was my first contact with a programming language in eighth or nineth grade. It was fun to build little forms and fill out event handlers and so on. I had my first revelation when we were supposed to write an animation. We created a stick figure that was supposed to wave. It was easy for me to have one arm go down but I did not go how it should go up again. It was then when the teacher introduced a variable that would indicate whether the arm goes up or down. This example seems silly but it was when I discovered imperative stateful programming.

Just in case you are wondering. I've never touched this language again after that class.

##Visual Basic
I wrote several Visual Basic programs in my high school year in the US. I don't remember much except that I wrote my first game: Pac-Man. Of course. I wish I could find the code. The little program did impress me.

In any case. I've only used Visual Basic one more time to write a map editor.

##C/C++
While Pascal and Visual Basic are just honorable mentions.

##PHP

##Javascript

##Java

##C-Sharp

##*Python
My second revelation.

##XQuery

##Ruby

##*Scala

##Bash
